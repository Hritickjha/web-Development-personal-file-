                <h3>Devops Engineer</h3>
                <p>I am a committed Leeds Beckett University Computer Science student passionate about software engineering, emphasizing algorithms, data structures, and backend development. My passion for problem-solving, DevRel, and DevOps drives me to keep learning and growing. I have accumulated a great deal of practical expertise in software engineering principles, project management, and various programming languages, including Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, over my academic career.

                     As a member of the Computer Science Society, I take part in coding competitions and hackathons to demonstrate my collaborative and problem-solving abilities. My involvement includes helping out as a volunteer for the University Tech Support Team, where I mentor and assist other students with technical issues.
                    
                    My involvement in several events and initiatives demonstrates my dedication to the tech community. I assist incoming students in navigating their academic and career trajectories as a volunteer for the Student Mentorship Program. To improve my skill set and stay current with industry developments, I have also earned several certifications, including Introduction to Cloud Computing, Automate Cybersecurity Tasks with Python, and AWS S3 Basics.
                    
                    I'm looking for chances to work with like-minded individuals and contribute to worthwhile projects.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><i>The <strong>"snake-Game"</strong> repository on GitHub, which was developed in Python and is curated by Hritickjha, is a humorous homage to the original Snake game. 
                                    The straightforward controls and UI of this project precisely capture the essence of the original game. Because the repository includes all the files needed for easy 
                                    setup and use, even novice coders can utilize it. The provided screenshot gives a preview of the game's visuals, and the simple installation and usage 
                                    instructions ensure that anyone can quickly get the game installed on their PC. Not only is this project interesting, but it provides a helpful example for anyone 
                                    interested in using Python to design games..</i></li></ul><br>

                                <li><i>Hritickjha has curated the <strong>"Java_project"</strong> repository, which is a useful teaching tool that highlights Java programming skills. 
                                    There are three levels to its extensive course offering: basic, intermediate, and advanced. While basic programs cover basic subjects
                                    like Hello World, basic calculators, and string manipulation, intermediate programs study sorting and searching techniques like Bubble 
                                    Sort and Binary Search. Advanced topics include object-oriented programming in-depth analyses, graph algorithms such as DFS and BFS, 
                                    and dynamic programming techniques. Java solutions are simple to understand and implement for both developers and learners, since each 
                                    application comes with extensive comments and explanations. The material in the repository, which showcases the collaboration and ongoing 
                                    learning of the Java community, is open to improvements.</i></li></ul><br>

                                <li><i>The <strong>"Full-Stack-App-python-Javascript-" </strong>repository was made by Hritickjha as a comprehensive teaching project that demonstrates how to develop a full-stack application.
                                    The backend is designed in Python using modules like Flask for RESTful API creation, SQLAlchemy for database management, and Marshmallow for data serialization.
                                    On the front end, JavaScript is used with React and Redux to create interactive user interfaces and manage states. The frontend and backend portions of the repository
                                    each have their own directories containing the setup-related dependencies and configuration files (which are listed in requirements.txt and package.json, respectively). 
                                    Users can clone the repository, install frontend and backend dependencies, create a virtual environment for the backend, and start the servers in order to run the application
                                    locally.</i></li></ul><br>

                                <li><i> A thorough reference for Java developers interested in software system development is Hritickjha's <strong>"Data-Structures-and-Algorithms" </strong> repository. It contains a collection 
                                    of Java apps that demonstrate the practical uses of fundamental data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees, along with algorithms for 
                                    sorting (such as Bubble Sort and Merge Sort) and searching (such as Binary Search). The repository includes additional projects and resources designed to enhance 
                                    understanding and proficiency with software development concepts. Users can explore and learn from various implementations by cloning the repository, gaining insight
                                     into efficient coding methods and ways to tackling Java problems.</i></li></ul><br>

                            <ul>
                                <li><i> The "GUI" repository showcases a variety of<strong>"graphical user interface (GUI)"</strong> developed using Java Swing and Tkinter frameworks. 
                                    It features implementations of essential GUI elements like checkboxes, comboboxes, and custom layouts. Additionally, functional programs 
                                    such as a simple counter and a square drawing application highlight practical uses of GUI concepts. The repository serves as both an educational 
                                    resource for learning GUI programming fundamentals and a repository for exploring more advanced GUI functionalities through hands-on examples.
                                    Developers can contribute to the repository by adding new GUI programs or improving existing ones, fostering collaborative learning and innovation in GUI
                                     development.</i></li></ul><br>
